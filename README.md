# CRISC Project in VHDL (Crabby RISC)

## The CRISC-1 CPU , or Crabby RISC, is a simplistic 8-bit RISC-based processor, made to learn and teach computer science subjects, such as “Computer Architecture”, “Digital Logic” and “Assembly Language”.

The HDL for the processor is being designed with VHDL with Vivado.
